# ATM-Simulation-using-CPP
A console-based ATM simulation built in C++ to practice OOP concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and constructors. Features secure PIN verification, limited login attempts, balance checking, withdrawals, deposits, and full input validation.

# Features:
-User authentication with a 4-digit PIN.

-Check balance.

-Withdraw money (with validation for insufficient funds + invalid input).

-Deposit money (with validation).

-Limits incorrect PIN attempts to 3.

-Clear and interactive console interface.

# Technologies Used:
-C++

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# How It Works
The program creates an ATM object with a starting balance and password.
Users can:

-Enter their PIN.

-Select transactions.

-Continue or exit.

-Automatically get blocked after 3 incorrect PIN attempts.

# Purpose of the Project:

This project was created to practice and demonstrate:

-Using classes and private/public members.

-Input validation.


-Basic control flow and menu handling.

-Building small console applications in C++.
